# ATAC_seeq_CNN_Graduation_Project
## Single-cell ATAC-seq using (CNN) convolutional neural networks .

### Objective :
Our aim is to build deep CNN (convolutional neural networks) model, using classification technique.
Takes a DNA sequence and predicts the type of the cell .
Based on chromatin accessibility (regions contains transcription factors) .

This data is contain of 4 columns and 1709 row which columns is :
1 – Label : Label which presents our cell types .
2- peak_name : The sample which from we get our sequence.
3 – location : refers to a genomic region on specific chromosome , with starting position  and ending position .
4 – sequence : Peaks of Genome .
