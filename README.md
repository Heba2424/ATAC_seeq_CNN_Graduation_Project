# ATAC_seeq_CNN_Graduation_Project
Single-cell ATAC-seq using (CNN) convolutional neural networks 
Our aim is to build deep CNN (convolutional neural networks) model, using classification technique.

Takes a DNA sequence and predicts the type of the cell .

Based on chromatin accessibility (regions contains transcription factors) .
