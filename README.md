# ATAC_seeq_CNN_Graduation_Project
## Single-cell ATAC-seq using (CNN) convolutional neural networks .

## Objective :
Our aim is to build deep CNN (convolutional neural networks) model, using classification technique.
Takes a DNA sequence and predicts the type of the cell .
Based on chromatin accessibility (regions contains transcription factors) .
